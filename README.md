# Simple Checkout Snippets

This repository provides a set of simple, configurable snippets to enhance and customize the storefront checkout flow. These tools are designed to make it easy to add additional UI elements and requirements to your checkout experience without complex development.

> This app is an example and is meant to be a starting point for developers to fork and add their own customizations to the checkout templates that are easily configurable through the dashboard UI.  

## Features

- **Custom HTML Above Payment Button:** Easily inject custom HTML content above the payment button.
- **Custom HTML Below Payment Button:** Add additional HTML content below the payment button.
